# React ViewStack

Simple viewstack with support for animated transitions.
Alternative to [ReactCSSTransitionGroup](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) with better control over in/out animation direction and transition effects out of the box.

## Usage

### For development
Checkout, install npm dependencies, then
* `npm run build` to compile  a dist version
* `npm run dev` to start a dev server with storybook environment on port `9001`


## Library format
Conforming to CommonJS format

## Todo
