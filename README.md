# React ViewStack

Simple viewstack with support for animated transitions.
Alternative to [ReactCSSTransitionGroup](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html) with better control over in/out animation direction and transition effects out of the box.

## Library format
Conforming to UMD standard
